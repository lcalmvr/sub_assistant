# Sandbox

Side projects and experiments. Not part of the main application.

## Projects

| Folder | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| `financial-crimes/` | Unified Financial Crimes Response - product/endorsement idea + internal memo | WIP |
| `vendor-marketing/` | Vendor panel marketing collateral | WIP |

| `mock_broker_platform/` | Demo showing how broker platforms would submit new business via API | POC/Demo |

## Why This Exists

These are document creation projects that use Claude for generating nice-looking PDFs (since Word output looks bad). Kept in this repo for convenience - easy to run parallel Claude sessions on main work and side projects.

## Utility

For HTML to PDF conversion, use: `python utils/html_to_pdf.py input.html [output.pdf]`
