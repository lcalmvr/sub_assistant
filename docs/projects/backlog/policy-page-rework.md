# Policy Page Rework

**Priority:** Medium
**Added:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Needs design

## Problem

Policy page was designed alongside Analyze V1 and Quote V1. Now outdated compared to the V2/V3 iterations on other pages.

## Context

- Analyze page went through V2 redesign
- Quote page went through V2 → V3 redesign
- Policy page still on original design
- Learnings from V2/V3 should apply here

## Potential Improvements

Based on V2/V3 patterns:
- Better information hierarchy
- Card-based layout consistency
- Quote/Submission toggle pattern
- Improved action buttons
- Section completion indicators
- Cleaner typography and spacing

## Current Policy Page Functions

- Policy details display
- Issuance checklist
- Document generation
- Policy status tracking
- Endorsement management?

## Next Steps

1. Audit current policy page
2. Identify what works / what doesn't
3. Apply V2/V3 patterns where appropriate
4. Design mockups
5. Prioritize changes
