# Endorsement Manuscriptor Tool

**Priority:** Medium
**Added:** 2025-01-24
**Status:** Needs scoping

## Problem

Need a tool for creating custom/manuscript endorsement language.

## Questions to Scope

- Who creates manuscript endorsements? (UW, legal, ops?)
- Starting from scratch or modifying templates?
- AI-assisted drafting?
- Approval workflow needed?
- Library of past manuscripts to reference?
- How does it integrate with quote/policy?
- Version control for endorsement language?

## Rough Concept

```
Manuscript Endorsement Editor
─────────────────────────────
Template: [Cyber Exclusion - Custom ▼]

┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ In consideration of the premium     │
│ charged, it is agreed that...       │
│                                     │
│ [AI Suggest] [Templates] [Preview]  │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

[Save Draft] [Submit for Review] [Add to Quote]
```

## Potential Features

- Template library
- AI-assisted drafting
- Legal review workflow
- Clause library / snippets
- Diff view for modifications
- Attach to quote/policy

## Next Steps

1. Understand current manuscript process
2. Identify who uses it and how often
3. Define MVP vs full feature
4. Decide on AI involvement level
